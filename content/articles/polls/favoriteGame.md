I asked a good friend this the other day and when I did I thought "That's kind of a difficult question." just as he responded with "Dude that's a huge question.", and it really is. When I asked, I couldn't come up with just one game, but, why is it so hard to pick?

# There are so many good games

If you asked me in 2000 what my favorite game was it would be 'Ocarina of Time', easily. 25 years later I've played so many games and types of games that its difficult for me to say what my favorite even is anymore. It is also hard to compare the memory of a game to one you are playing now, but maybe thats the thing to focus on: how the game makes you feel.

# Follow the feeling

The game I've played most by hours is 'Arma 3', and its a top contender, but I am reluctant to call it my favorite.
