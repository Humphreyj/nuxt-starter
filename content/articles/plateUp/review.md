A surprsingly accurate cooking sim in a nice cartoon package.

# Plan your restaurant layout

I did not like 'Overcooked' because it sets you up to fail, which I know is the point, but its just really annoying. In PlateUp! you have control over the layout of the entire restaurant, so if you fail, it is because of poor planning or lack of skill. This is infinitely more satisfying.

# Intended or not, the immersion is strong

I worked in kitchens for 12 years and PlateUp! accurately portrays what its like. The lunch and dinner rushes are stressful, you think about quitting and never doing this again, and the customers are assholes.

If playing with friends, like the owner of a restaurant I cooked at would yell at us 'You've got to communicate!', this is true here as well. Failure to communicate will quickly end your run, and possibly a friendship.

# One angry customer is all it takes

If even one customer gets upset, you fail the run. I really disliked this at first, but honestly its not fun to be in the weeds. Also it fulfills the ultimate line cook fantasy of your hellish existence just suddenly ending without you having to clean up.
