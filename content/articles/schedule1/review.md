I knew I was going to have a problem with _Schedule 1_ from the moment I started playing. It wasn’t the charming low-poly graphics or the chill lo-fi soundtrack—those were great. I just instantly knew I was going to play way too much of it.

_Schedule 1_ is a game about selling drugs in a cozy little West Coast city. You start with just a few hundred bucks in your pocket after escaping the police, leaving your wheelchair-bound uncle to fend for himself. Luckily, he’s pretty cool about it and never brings it up.

# Low Poly, High Charm

A lot of low-poly games share a similar art style, but _Schedule 1_ stands out with its unique character and object design. The buildings and environments are simple, but the characters give off strong _Home Movies_ vibes—far from your typical low-poly asset pack look. The objects are detailed and satisfying to interact with, making the world feel alive.

One thing that definitely surprised me? How much fun I had picking up trash in the early game just to make some seed money.

# It’s Just Fun

The game doesn’t hold your hand. If you need product, you have to create it. Growing herbs from seeds involves every step of the process: pouring soil into a pot, planting the seed, covering it, and watering it. Once it’s grown, you harvest each bud individually, then package it for sale.

Every step generates some trash—a used soil bag, an empty seed container—which makes it feel like you’re actually doing something instead of just pressing a button. I thought it might get old, but nearly 30 hours in, it hasn’t. Plus, once you reach a certain income level, you can automate the process with employees, letting you focus on expanding your operation.

# Can’t Wait to See What’s Next

_Schedule 1_ has been immensely successful so far, hitting 400,000 concurrent players on Steam, and I think—just like my character’s net worth—that number is only going up. I can’t wait to see what TVGS does next, and I’ll be waiting impatiently to get my next fix.
