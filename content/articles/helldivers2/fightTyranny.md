Helldivers 2 had a very rocky start. Server issues plagued the launch, with players struggling to get into matches or even connect at all. On top of that, the requirement to link a PlayStation Network (PSN) account—even for Steam players—sparked a fair bit of frustration. Some features were buggy, others just didn’t work right out of the gate.

But despite all that, it was still one of the most exciting launches in recent memory—and that’s thanks entirely to the players. The community rallied around the chaos, turning connection errors into memes and frustrating bugs into moments of shared suffering. Everyone was all-in for Super Earth and the war effort, shouting “FOR DEMOCRACY!” while getting obliterated by accidental orbital strikes or surprise bug ambushes. It was messy, loud, and weirdly inspiring.

# More weapons, more stratagems!

As the dust began to settle post-launch, the updates started rolling in. New weapons and stratagems gave Helldivers even more ways to accidentally destroy each other in the name of liberty. From high-powered railguns to hilariously overkill airstrikes, the arsenal keeps growing—and so does the need for coordination (or at least an apology system).

Stratagems remain the backbone of any successful mission, and new ones have added exciting layers to the chaos. Whether it’s deploying a mech suit or dropping a carpet bomb on a bug nest, the sheer variety keeps things fresh every time you drop into a war zone.

# New faction, more missions

Perhaps the biggest shake-up came with the introduction of a new enemy faction. Just when Helldivers had started to get a handle on the Automatons and Terminids, a third threat emerged—more dangerous, more unpredictable, and just as intent on dismantling Super Earth's glorious regime.

With the new faction came new mission types and objectives. Players now face multi-stage assaults, faction-specific hazards, and more dynamic events that change how you approach the battlefield. Gone are the days of simply extracting data or blowing up a nest—now you're fighting for control, managing limited resources, and pushing back against enemy-controlled planets in a full-blown galactic war.

Helldivers 2 has come a long way from its rough launch, and it's clear that Arrowhead Game Studios is committed to supporting the game and its community. With constant updates, community-driven campaigns, and a war effort that evolves based on player performance, it’s more than just a co-op shooter—it’s a living, breathing satire of militarism, all wrapped up in chaotic, bug-squashing fun.

So gear up, call in your favorite stratagem, and don’t forget to thank your teammates—unless they drop an airstrike on you. In that case, it's probably your fault.

FOR SUPER EARTH.
