# A Universe That Feels Empty

One of Starfield’s biggest selling points was its sheer scale—over a thousand planets to explore. But size isn’t everything. The vast majority of these worlds are barren, repetitive, and devoid of meaningful content. Procedural generation can be a powerful tool, but here, it often feels like a crutch rather than a feature. Exploration should feel rewarding, yet in Starfield, it quickly becomes tedious.

# Space Travel That’s… Not Really Space Travel

When Bethesda teased Starfield, many players imagined seamlessly piloting their ship between planets, engaging in real-time space travel and thrilling dogfights. Instead, the experience is heavily menu-driven, with loading screens breaking up every transition. There’s no real sense of scale or immersion in space travel—it feels more like fast-traveling through a glorified menu than actually navigating a galaxy.

# Could Have Been More, Settled for Less

Starfield is by no means a bad game. It has moments of brilliance—some well-crafted quests, engaging combat, and an intriguing aesthetic. But it could have been so much more. Bethesda played it safe when it had the chance to revolutionize the sci-fi RPG genre. Instead of feeling like a giant leap forward, Starfield lands as a cautious step—one that didn’t quite reach the stars. If Bethesda had just tried a little harder, Starfield could have been a defining game of the decade. Instead, it remains a solid but unremarkable entry in the RPG space.
