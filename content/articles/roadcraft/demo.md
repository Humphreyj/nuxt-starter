# The Deforestation Simulator

Sometimes you need a tree gone, sometimes you just suck at driving.

# Have an impact on the world.

Leave your mark on the landscape, and the environment.

# I am excited to play more.

I played the Roadcraft demo for about 12 hours, probably the longest I had ever spent on a demo.
