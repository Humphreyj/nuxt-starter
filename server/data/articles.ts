        text: 'One of Starfield’s biggest selling points was its sheer scale—over a thousand planets to explore. But size isn’t everything. The vast majority of these worlds are barren, repetitive, and devoid of meaningful content. Procedural generation can be a powerful tool, but here, it often feels like a crutch rather than a feature. Exploration should feel rewarding, yet in Starfield, it quickly becomes tedious.',

        text: 'When Bethesda teased Starfield, many players imagined seamlessly piloting their ship between planets, engaging in real-time space travel and thrilling dogfights. Instead, the experience is heavily menu-driven, with loading screens breaking up every transition. There’s no real sense of scale or immersion in space travel—it feels more like fast-traveling through a glorified menu than actually navigating a galaxy.',
